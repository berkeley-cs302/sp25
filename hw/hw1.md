## Directions

Set up a weekly sync with your fellow co-instructors. Discuss high-level thoughts for the summer at the first meeting. Document the weekly sync time/day and high-level notes from your first meeting in the responses document.

Pro tip: Homeworks will always be due on Wednesdays, so it's probably best if you can schedule your weekly syncs before Wednesdays to get 302 homework done/started together.

### Implicit Bias Training

[Complete the implicit bias training.](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/working-at-uc/your-career/talent-management/professional-development/managing-implicit-bias.html#:~:text=The%20UC%20Managing%20Implicit%20Bias,its%20impact%20at%20the%20University.&text=The%20series%20contains%20the%20following,to%2020%20minutes%20in%20length)

You will need to click through a few times to get to the UC Berkeley login for the training website.

Please submit a screenshot of the completion screen (or confirmation email) to show that you have finished this (with some sort of evidence that it is in fact your own screen...). Place your screenshot in this folder. Each person writes one new thing they learned in the response document.
