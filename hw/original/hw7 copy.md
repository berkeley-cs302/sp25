The departmental summer staff form is soon to be released, so let’s get ready for applications/interviewing/hiring!

## Final todo’s with Hiring Form

Recall the hiring forms you made in [<u>Homework 3</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5fJv8QFfwSsUnF_e-mOQUPbFX9a40M2r3JfhBivhFc/edit). The plan is to have the supplemental forms linked directly on the [<u>eecs application</u>](https://deptapps.eecs.berkeley.edu/ase/eecs/apply). Here are some important things to double check:

1.  Check the permission settings so only you and co instructors can access responses

2.  Check [<u>https://deptapps.eecs.berkeley.edu/ase/eecs/apply</u>](https://deptapps.eecs.berkeley.edu/ase/eecs/apply) that your hiring form is properly linked for your course

3.  Add your hiring form to the [<u>eecs 101 piazza summer 2022 course information post</u>](https://piazza.com/class/hyq0br1u3kx7dg?cid=16543)

4.  Send the form to yourself and try submitting, going through each question, as a final proofread for any last minute fixes

5.  Monitor as the first few responses come in to make sure you are getting the information you need from candidates

There is nothing to turn in for 302 for this section. We recommend doing it ASAP since applications are going live very soon (or have already gone live).

## Advertising

A solid team is crucial for a successful course offering. By advertising your application to more people, you get more applicants, and more qualified candidates to do a great job teaching your course.

A few ideas of where/who to advertise:

- Current and past course staff through slack posts or even direct messages

- Course Piazza/Ed, especially for past semesters

- EECS 101 Ed, [<u>https://eecs.link/join-ed</u>](https://eecs.link/join-ed)

- Eecs/cs majors at berkeley mailing list

- Physical flyers at Soda/Cory hall

- Reddit, Discord, Facebook

- Etc!

Mention where you advertised in the responses document and check out what the other instructors did for inspiration.

A lot of these locations are also good places to advertise your course if you have low enrollment.

## Academic Misconduct Policy

What student facing messaging will you have about Academic Honesty and Misconduct? Draft your policy. You should then add this to your syllabus.
