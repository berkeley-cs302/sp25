The departmental application priority deadline was in mid-March! Now it is time to start hiring.

## Add Hiring Schedule

Many students apply to many courses, and it can be helpful to align hiring schedules with other classes to benefit both students and instructors.

On the [<u>responses document</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xF8Ttd0cH_g4wYxyVelGFRaFoi5UXbZvDwaTKEZgIHo/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs), write your timeline for:

1.  Interviews

2.  Submitting hire requests for returning staff

3.  Submitting hire requests for new staff

Reach out to the other courses/check their answers and try to see if you can reach a consensus for a good time to send requests. Ideally you can send requests for hiring on the same day.

## Review Applications

Keep in mind your managing bias training to help avoid any biases when reviewing applications.

Nothing to turn in for this.

## Schedule Interviews

If you plan to do interviews for hiring consideration, now is the time to start planning and scheduling them.

Nothing to turn in for this.

## Plan Your Course “Logistics”

Work with your teammates to prepare an approximately 5-10 minutes long lecture segment introducing the course format. This should fit into your first lecture when you introduce your course to your students.

For inspiration, check out recent semester offerings of your course and their first lecture, especially from the summer. Here is an example from [<u>CS61A Summer 2021</u>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S_SgXqbUGhZWFlYVq_ncX2bXxw7_Sdy6WijlWtsR0DM/edit#slide=id.g3b0b23947b_0_207), specifically slides 15 - 35. You need not read the entire syllabus, but we should come away understanding the most important aspects of what it means to be a successful student in your course.

We don’t have time to present them all, but think about what students should know to be successful. What’s different about a summer course, or a Berkeley course compared to High School (especially for those of you with Freshmen)?
