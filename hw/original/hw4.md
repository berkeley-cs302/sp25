## Half of First Exam Draft

Exam writing can be a time consuming and difficult task, especially if you have never written exam problems before. By getting your exams finished before the summer even starts, you can have one less thing to worry about and have to do during your busy summer.

For this assignment you will be drafting half of your first exam. If your course does quizzes instead, draft a whole quiz.

Please create a Google doc, PDF, or Overleaf draft of half of your exam / a whole quiz and share with the instructors.
