## Directions

Set up a weekly sync with your fellow co-instructors. Discuss high-level thoughts for the summer at the first meeting. Document the weekly sync time/day and high-level notes from your first meeting in the responses document.

Pro tip: Homeworks will always be due on Wednesdays, so it's probably best if you can schedule your weekly syncs before Wednesdays to get 302 homework done/started together.
